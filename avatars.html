        Odd guy 3 was made out of a modeling slump. I'd had worked on an avatar for 2 months and completely scrapped it.
        Later I was watching a YouTube video on the skin modifier. I had used the skin modifier before but I didn't know
        you could scale it on different axes. Which inspired me to build a character which would become odd guy 3. But I
        got a three didn't take two months it was made in just a few days and honestly this model was so much better 😂.
